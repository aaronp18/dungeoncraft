<h4>What is it?</h4>
Well in short, this plugin allows you to easily add "dungeons" where you can fight waves of mobs on your own or with friends.
 
Features include:
 - The ability to have multiple of the same **dungeon** running simultaneously in different arenas, ideal for larger servers.
 - The ability to configure how many and what mobs spawn each wave.
 - The ability to spawn mobs with your custom NBT data (you can give them enchanted armour etc)
 - Parties, which allow multiple people to join the same dungeon.
 - Difficulty scaling when more players play (makes it more balanced)
 - Loot rewards can be changed to either spread amongst all the players or to give all of them the same reward.
 - Loot rewards that scale with the difficulty.
 - The ability to run commands when the dungeons are completed, enabling you to give custom items or trigger other plugins.

 <h4>Setup</h4>
 Firstly, you may be asking whats the difference between a **Dungeon** and an **Arena**. Well simply put, **Dungeons** are the set of waves that spawn a set of mobs, whereas an **Arena** is just the place where this can take place. 
This means that you can design 1 **Dungeon** with a set of custom waves which can be played simultaneously in many different **arenas** for many differnt players. These **Arenas** auto provision themselves which means you won't have two games going on in the same **Arena**. Cool right?
